This project was written in c++17. A small program utilizing the engine can be ran here: https://onlinegdb.com/T8BmPGdQOA

I wanted to make this project as a fun little exercise to accompany my interest in finite state automata and regular expressions after first learning about them in a
discrete structures course I took in college.

I eventually want to incorporate some of the common features I've seen in other regular expression engines such as character classes and functions for finding and replacing pattern matches 
in strings.

NOTE: Small bug during pattern parsing causing expressions to be incorrect/unexpected and not be evaluated. Currently fixing.
